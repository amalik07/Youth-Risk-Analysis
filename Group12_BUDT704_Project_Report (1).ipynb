    "Risky behaviors are acts that increase the risk of disease or injury, which could eventually threaten health or even life. Especially, potentially risky behaviors that youths engage in will impact their well-being and life prospects (Gruber, 2001). Activities such as smoking, consuming alcohol, having sex, and taking drugs will cause consequences for the remainder of their lives. Therefore, our group would like to gain a better understanding of youth risk behavior patterns and draw insights that can help teenagers create lifelong healthy behaviors. Our project builds a surveillance system that analyzes three categories of health risk behavior among the youth: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Alcoholism and drug abuse \n",
    "* Unhealthy Sexual Behavior\n",
    "* Tobacco Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained a data set, which contains 2,740,200 rows and 35 columns of observations, from Kaggle. It is about a Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) that conducts surveys to collect information from high school students in terms of adverse health behaviors in over 100 schools in the United States. The survey data ranges from 1991 to 2017 and associates a risk percentage to specific health-related issues over various demographic categories such as race, grade, sex, and location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data set, we come up with some meaningful questions and would like to explore more: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Is there an increase in tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use among youth over the years in different regions and states of the United States of America?** <br>\n",
    "(We aim to determine if drug use behaviors including consuming alcohol, marijuana, heroin, or ecstasy increased over years in different states across the US. We look for the change of trend in drug use behaviors and how it differs in terms of the type of drug, years, and states.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Which student demographics are susceptible to different substance abuse and sexual behaviors?**<br>\n",
    "(We want to check if there is any relationship between different demographics and risky behaviors. We would like to see how sex, grade, race, and location may influence the youth's tendency to engage in drug use and sexual behaviors. )\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Does excessive alcohol/drug abuse lead to higher chances of sexually transmitted diseases among high school students?**<br>\n",
    "(We plan to determine whether the alcohol or drug use behavior will cause a higher likelihood of engaging in sexual behaviors which may further increase sexually transmitted diseases among youth. We try to determine whether there is a relationship between those risky behaviors and if yes what type of correlation coefficient exists.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How does the risky behavior among youth in different grades change over the years? Is there any significant pattern in risky behavior over the years for high school girls and boys?**<br>\n",
    "(We intend to determine the trend of engaging in risky behaviors in different high school grades in recent two decades. Also, we would like to check if teens in different genders show different risky behavior patterns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the dataset, we will be able to find some helpful relationships between behaviors and experiences among high school students and figure out the change patterns of risky behaviors over time and place. Based on that, we can provide some insights and suggestions on how to enhance the current law enforcement and improve legal regulations to prevent high school students from engaging in risky behaviors. Furthermore, our system will prove beneficial for giving guidance to various non-profit organizations on helping and protecting at-risk young adults and teenagers in the United States. "

    "Our group make the decision that our project should be graded more heavily on data processing. The reason why we believe the work we did goes above and beyond the basic data processing needed for most data sets is that our data set has three topics in separate sheets and we have made a great effort to clean and process each sheet before merging them into one.  We spent time understanding this huge data set before we drop any irrelevant information. Then we conducted the tasks such as recording, reindexing and changing data types to further process the data in each sheet. "

Therefore, the methods that we used to clean and process data are similar for each sheet. However in the end we have concatenated all the three sheets and set the index again and used a final dataset for our analysis."

We reorder the columns in a way that as we read the data from left to the right, we gain more knowledge about the data in a logical and sequential manner. We index the data with the appropriate columns so that the data is grouped logically and each question of the study is uniquely placed in the dataframe.

In the early 90s the alcohol consumption in youth was limited to some states but as we move ahead in time the consumption has been prevalant in various states, if not increasing. The risk percentage is reducing but the map is getting denser with time that could mean that the teenagers indulging in such activities are increasing but are not at high risk. The access to alcohol has become easier leading to an increase of youth participation in it. Although, the youth is just as much aware of the consequences of alcoholism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we compare the data from all states with one another the states on the East coast such as New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island and Denver are most prone to risk behavior resulting from alcohol. Overall for all states the intensity of the risk spiked in the year 2005 and continued until its decline after 2011. To be precise the risk value was consistently increasing after 2001. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The states on the west coast such as California and Nevada has consistent risk intensity of alcoholism throughout the years.  But one exception can be seen in the region near San Francisco and Los Angeles. The alcohol risk percentage was relatively low but the density of the risk increased by a good major after the year 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The mid west as a whole has seen an increase in alcoholic risk behavior among youth. The early 90s had less density of alcohol risk behavior but as the years passed more and more mid-western teenagers indulged in this activity. The most percentage of teens at risk in this region was recorded in the year 2007 with Illinois having 56.229% of teenagers at risk. Just like the east coast the density of teenagers participating in the alcohol began increasing after 2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the southern states the alcohol risk behavior has been prevalant throughout the years. The most density of the risk activity was observed in 2011 especially in Louisana with over 48.585% of teenagers at risk.

    "#### East Coast\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking through the observations it can be concluded that the states on the East coast are the most suseptable to risk behaviors related to alcohol and drug abuse. This could be due to the following reasons:\n",
    "- Densely populated states: The states with more population will more youth involving in these activities. As there is more population these regions are expensive leading to increased financial and mental health issues.\n",
    "- Metropolitan areas: States with more urban regions will have more risky activities among youth because alcohol and drugs are more accessible.\n",
    "- Progressive population\n",
    "- Closer to the coast: The import of illegal substances is much easier in these states leading to youth being exposed to it.\n",
    "- Mental health issues: Increase in such health issues among the adults could lead to weak relationships between parents and their teenage children.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Florida\n",
    "\n",
    "Another region which has a significant risk of youth engaging in alcohol and drug abuse is Florida. The reasons for the same could be:\n",
    "- Closer to ports\n",
    "- Popular location for recreation\n",
    "- Major drug rings in the state (according to the findings [here](https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs5/5169/overview.htm))\n",
    "- Less stringent laws and authority\n",
    "\n",
    "#### West Coast\n",

    "It was expected to find Nevada and California to high usage of marijuana usage among youth as marijuana was legalised in these states in 1996 and 2000 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2001 to 2005\n",
    "\n",
    "The alcohol usage risk among youth was increasing since the start of 2001 to 2005 on the East Coast and Mid-West. The cause for the surge in the risk could be due to the 9/11 incident. Undoutedly it shocked the whole nation but the youth in these regions would have been most effected. Many of them might have lost either of their parents in the incident causing them absolute despair. As seen in this [article](https://headsup.scholastic.com/students/scientists-find-a-connection-between-911-and-substance-abuse/#:~:text=There%20was%20also%20indication%20of,these%20substances%20before%209%2F11.) there was an increase in mental health diseases such PTSD leading to more alcohol usage and substance abuse."

Then we will filter the groups with 'Greater_Risk_Data_Value' above 40 percent and find that count. Based on the previous two counts calculated we can calculate the percentage of observations we have for high risk(greater than 40% risk value) for the particular group. "

    "and change in parent child relationship. Parents lately have been monitoring activities of their children more closely. Also youth in early 2000s might have started taking part in extra curricular activties like trying new sports, learning new skills, and engaging in confidence-building activities. Studies conducted by few research professors as found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6874743/)  they have attributed decline in risky behavior to effective public policies (such as anti-smoking programs), closer parent-child relationships, and the social consequences of electronic media use.\n",

For example, Hillsborough County, Florida, used YRBS data to enhance health education, physical education, and health science education programs and to create a guide for high school science teachers to use when discussing specific topics related to HIV, STDs, and unintended pregnancies. In Michigan, YRBS data are used to plan and advocate for coordinated school health programs and other health-related initiatives in their state. The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) developed the SFUSD Family Guide, which combines its YRBS data in an easy-to-read form with information on related school health programs, national research, and strategies for promoting health at home."
